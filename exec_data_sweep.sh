# This script automates the process of simulating and synthesizing the processor design
# across a range of RAM latencies to evaluate performance and timing.

# commandline:
#   bash exec_data_sweep_updated.sh
#       OR
#   bash exec_data_sweep_updated.sh -d
#       -d: enable dual-core simulation for Labs 10, 11, and 12

# NOTE: mergesort.asm / dual.mergesort.asm are used by default. If this script
#       doesn't work on your design, you may need to manually change the asm_file variable.

# NOTE: lat0.txt, lat2.txt, lat6.txt, lat10.txt, sim_results.txt, and syn_results.txt are
#       reserved temporary file names used by this script.
